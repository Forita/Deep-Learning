- Implemented a model which inputs a sentence and finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with this sentence.

- Emojifier-V1.0 model used word embeddings, while Emojifier-V2.0 model added LSTMs on top of Emojifier-V1.0.  

- Both Emojifier-V1.0 and Emojifier-V2.0 had high accuracy and could generalize correct emojis to unseen words. 

- Emojifier-V2.0 performed better than Emojifier-V1.0 at understanding complex sentences.
