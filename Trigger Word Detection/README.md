- Created a speech dataset with a mix of positive words (trigger words) and negative words (non-trigger words) on different background noises using data synthesis. 
- Implemented a model consisting of 1-D convolutional layers, GRU layers and dense layers, and optimized it by Adam optimizer and binary cross entropy loss.
